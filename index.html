                <h2>A computer science lover who wants to do everything!</h2>
                <p>
                    I have had the pleasure of working with different programming
                    languages and I wish I could use them all! At the heart of my
                    programming passion is a love for computers and all things technology.
                    From a kid till now, I have always wanted to make mine and others dreams
                    come true with the power of code. Whether that's designing a website,
                    learning to make a game, or help develop a search algorithm. I have wanted to do
                    it all and I have attempted most of it too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take a journey with me to discover the untapped potential of what a line of 
                    code can do for you...
