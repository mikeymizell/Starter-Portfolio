## Starter Portfolio!

### Goals: 
- Create a portfolio that shows the work I have created so far in this class
- Learn how to make a website on my own
- Use a wireframe and learn how to properly implement it
- Use all of the resources I was given throughout the past couple weeks

### What did I learn?
In this module I learned a lot about how I should handle code on my own and how I should think of the different elements on a webpage. When laying it all out on a wireframe,
your html won't look exactly like that for a while. The wireframe helped me get a base of how I want to setup my website but having to figure out how the logic played out on screen
was a bit different. 

Overall, I feel as if I did solid. I don't feel I excelled but I would love to learn more and make an awesome portfolio that truly displays my skills!
